1. Gain a basic understanding of JSON.
2. Learn the differences between JSON and XML.
3. Understand how to create a JSON file.
4. Acquire skills in performing JSON operations using JavaScript and PHP.
5. Gain the ability to retrieve data, such as exchange rates, prayer times, and weather information, by reading JSON files shared on the internet.
